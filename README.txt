Testing SASS/React

note to self: 

npm install babel-preset-es2015 babel-preset-react


start /b sass --watch source:public & ^
start /b babel --presets es2015,react --watch source/ --out-dir public/  & ^
start /b http-server ./

I don't like the way the edit/delete buttons take up so much space, it might be cleaner to have it only appear once a recipe is open.
